## 🐛 Still Getting 404?

### Check Your Settings:

3. If it's empty or shows something else, **YOU MUST SET IT TO `client`**

2. Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` exists
3. Verify the value points to your actual backend URL

### Check Build Logs:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Look for errors in the logs
4. Share the error message if you see one

## 📸 What You Should See

### In Settings → General → Root Directory:
```
Root Directory: client    [Edit]
```

### In Settings → Environment Variables:
```

https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
Production, Preview, Development
```

### In Deployment Logs:
```

## 🎯 Summary

The **#1 most critical step** is setting:
