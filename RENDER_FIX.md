# 🚀 Render Deployment Fix Guide

## ❌ Current Problem

Your Render deployment is running `client/server.js` which only serves static files. It doesn't run the backend API server, so all `/api/auth/login` requests return 404.

## ✅ The Solution

You need to configure Render to:
1. Build the frontend (client)
2. Run the BACKEND server (server/index.js)
3. The backend will serve both API endpoints AND the frontend static files

---

## 🔧 Option 1: Configure via Render Dashboard (Recommended)

### Step 1: Go to Your Render Service Settings

1. Open https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your **NeoPress** service
3. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Update Build & Start Commands

Update these settings:

**Root Directory:**
```
(leave empty or enter: .)
```

**Build Command:**
```bash
cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ../server && npm install
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
cd server && node index.js
```

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

Make sure these are set (Settings → Environment Variables):

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
NEWSAPI_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
```

### Step 4: Redeploy

1. Click **Manual Deploy** → **Clear build cache & deploy**
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Test your app!

## 🔧 Option 2: Use render.yaml (Automatic)

I've created a `render.yaml` file in your repository. To use it:

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Render configuration with render.yaml"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: In Render Dashboard

1. Go to your service
2. Click **Settings**
3. Look for **"Blueprint"** or **"render.yaml"** section
4. Enable "Deploy from render.yaml"
5. Redeploy

## 📋 What the Fix Does

### Before (Broken):
```
Render runs: client/server.js
  ↓
Only serves React static files
  ↓
No backend API running
  ↓
/api/auth/login returns 404 ❌
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Render runs: server/index.js
  ↓
Backend API running on /api/*
  ↓
Backend also serves React static files at /*
  ↓
/api/auth/login works! ✅
```

## 🧪 How to Verify It's Working

After redeploying, check the Render logs. You should see:

```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ HTTP Server running on port 10000
Registered API routes:
  - /api/news/*
  - /api/articles/*
  - /api/analytics/*
  - /api/auth/login (POST)
  - /api/auth/register (POST)
  - /api/auth/me (GET)
```

Then test your app:
1. Visit your Render URL
2. Go to login page
3. Try logging in
4. Check browser console - should see `[API CONFIG]` log with correct baseURL
5. Login should work! ✅

---

## 🆘 If It Still Doesn't Work

Check these common issues:

### 1. Wrong Start Command
Make sure Render is running `cd server && node index.js`, NOT `npm run serve` or `node client/server.js`

### 2. Missing Environment Variables
Check that all required env vars are set in Render dashboard

### 3. Build Failed
Check build logs for errors. Make sure both client and server dependencies install correctly

### 4. MongoDB Connection
Make sure `MONGODB_URI` is correct and MongoDB Atlas allows connections from Render's IP (0.0.0.0/0)

## 📞 Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Root Directory: (empty) or `.`
- [ ] Build Command: `cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ../server && npm install`
- [ ] Start Command: `cd server && node index.js`
- [ ] All environment variables set
- [ ] Manual deploy with cleared cache
- [ ] Check logs for "HTTP Server running"
- [ ] Test login endpoint

---

## 💡 Why This Happened

Your `client/package.json` has:
```json
"start": "node server.js"
```

This tells Render to run `client/server.js`, which is just a static file server. It doesn't know about your API backend.

The fix is to run the actual backend server (`server/index.js`), which is already configured to serve both API endpoints AND frontend static files in production mode.

Good luck! 🚀
